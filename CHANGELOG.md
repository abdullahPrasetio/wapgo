## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`wapgo make:worker [name] [--broker kafka|rabbitmq|both]`** — new CLI command that generates
  a standalone worker binary entrypoint. Without a name: `cmd/worker/main.go`. With a name:
  `cmd/worker-{name}/main.go`. The `--broker` flag selects which messaging integration to scaffold;
  omitting it auto-detects from `go.mod` (checks for `segmentio/kafka-go` and `rabbitmq/amqp091-go`).
  Two Makefile targets (`run-{suffix}` and `build-{suffix}`) are appended automatically when a
  `Makefile` is detected. Generated worker uses the shared `*Connection` pattern for RabbitMQ
  so a single TCP socket serves all consumers.
- **RabbitMQ — shared connection type** (`pkg/messaging/rabbitmq.Connection`): a single
  `*Connection` is created once per process and passed to all `Publisher` and `Consumer` instances.
  Eliminates the connection-explosion problem where N consumers/publishers previously created N TCP
  sockets to the broker, crashing RabbitMQ under load.
  - `NewConnection(dsn, log)` — dials with 5 s timeout + 10 s heartbeat; double-checked locking
    for reconnect to prevent concurrent races.
  - `Connection.Channel()` — opens a new AMQP channel; auto-reconnects the underlying connection
    transparently on channel failure.
  - `Connection.Close()` — shuts down the shared TCP connection; call once during shutdown.
- **RabbitMQ — blocking `Subscribe` with auto-reconnect**: `Consumer.Subscribe(ctx, queue, rk, handler)`
  now blocks until `ctx` is cancelled, reconnecting the channel automatically with exponential
  backoff (1 s → 30 s cap) when the broker restarts. Channel death is detected via `amqp.NotifyClose`.
  > ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** — `Subscribe` signature changed: added `ctx context.Context` as first
  > parameter, and the method now **blocks** (previously returned immediately and spun an internal
  > goroutine). Callers must wrap in a goroutine: `go consumer.Subscribe(ctx, queue, rk, handler)`.
  > The `cmd/worker-*/main.go` scaffold and all skeleton templates already use this pattern.
- **RabbitMQ — publisher channel retry**: `Publisher.Publish` reopens its channel once on error
  before returning, so a broker restart is transparent to callers in most cases.
- **Kafka — exponential backoff on fetch error**: `Consumer.Start` now waits 1 s before the first
  retry after a fetch failure, doubling each attempt up to 30 s, using a `select` on `ctx.Done`
  so shutdown is still immediate. Backoff resets to 1 s on the next successful fetch.
- **Kafka — session configuration**: `HeartbeatInterval: 3s`, `SessionTimeout: 30s`,
  `RebalanceTimeout: 30s`, and `ErrorLogger` (surfaces internal reader errors via zerolog) added
  to `NewConsumer`'s `ReaderConfig`.
- **Redis — connection pool configuration**: six new fields in `RedisConfig` with explicit
  ENV bindings and sane defaults:
  `REDIS_POOL_SIZE` (20), `REDIS_MIN_IDLE_CONNS` (5), `REDIS_DIAL_TIMEOUT` (5s),
  `REDIS_READ_TIMEOUT` (3s), `REDIS_WRITE_TIMEOUT` (3s), `REDIS_MAX_RETRIES` (3).
  `REDIS_URL` replaces the old `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` pair (URL format: `redis://host:port`).

### Fixed
- **Skeleton IDE false positives** — all 44 plain `.go` skeleton files under
  `cli/generator/templates/skeleton/` renamed to `.go.tmpl`. The `//go:build ignore` guard
  (needed to exclude skeleton sources from the CLI build) caused gopls to analyze each file
  independently, making cross-file references (e.g. `Connection` in `connection.go` referenced
  from `consumer.go`) appear as "undefined" in the IDE. With `.go.tmpl` extension gopls skips
  these files entirely; the generated user project is unaffected.
  `scaffold.go` updated: template files are now rendered to a `strings.Builder` first so the
  module-path placeholder (`github.com/abdullahPrasetio/wapgo`) is replaced after rendering,
  keeping `AddFeatureFiles` consistent.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`wapgo upgrade`** — new CLI command to check for a newer release and self-update via
  `go install`. Flags: `--check` (report only, no install). Offline-safe: network errors
  are non-fatal warnings.

### Fixed
- **`wapgo new` scaffold** — `go mod tidy` no longer fails after scaffolding. Root cause:
  `cmd/api/main.go.tmpl` imported `[[.Module]]/docs` (Swagger generated package) which
  does not exist until the user runs `swag init`. The import has been removed.
  `router.go` template also had a `github.com/gofiber/swagger` import that is not included
  in the generated `go.mod`; the swagger route and its dependency have been removed from
  the skeleton (users can add it manually via `wapgo add` or by generating docs separately).

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Swagger/OpenAPI docs** (`/docs`) — `github.com/gofiber/swagger` + `swaggo/swag`; full `@Summary`,
  `@Router`, `@Param`, `@Success`, `@Failure` annotations on all user and health handlers; `docs/`
  directory generated via `swag init -g cmd/api/main.go --parseDependency --parseInternal`.
  Route `/docs/*` is guarded by `prodGuard` — returns 404 in production, Swagger UI in all other envs.
- **Welcome page** (`GET /`) — lightweight JSON landing: `{service, version, env, links}`.
  In production `links` only exposes `/health`; in dev/staging also exposes `/docs` and `/metrics`.
- **`wapgo make:test`** — new CLI generator with two layers:
  - `--layer usecase` (default) — usecase unit tests with a hand-written `mock.Mock` repository;
    covers `Get*_OK`, `Get*_NotFound`, `Get*_InvalidUUID`, `List*_OK`, `Create*_OK`, `Delete*_OK`.
  - `--layer handler` — HTTP handler tests using a struct-based mock usecase + `httptest`;
    covers all five CRUD operations, invalid body, validation failure, and each error status code.
  - Both layers are generated automatically by `wapgo make:all <name>`.
- CLI skeleton `internal/delivery/http/route/router.go` updated: includes `GET /`, `GET /docs/*`
  (prodGuard), and `github.com/gofiber/swagger` import; `cmd/api/main.go.tmpl` imports `docs` package.

---

## [0.11.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- `pkg/logger` — data race on global sink variables: concurrent calls to `SetupSinks` (writes) and
  `API()`/`Consumer()`/`ThirdParty()`/`Trace()` (reads) caused a detected race under `-race` on Linux
  CI. Fixed by replacing plain `zerolog.Logger` vars with `atomic.Pointer[zerolog.Logger]`-backed
  `sinkHolder`, making all reads and writes lock-free and race-safe.
- CI — `golangci-lint-action@v6` rejects version strings of the form `v2.x.x` (golangci-lint v2 not
  supported); upgraded to `golangci-lint-action@v7`.
- CI — Go toolchain upgraded from `1.25.8` to `1.25.11`; Go 1.25.0–1.25.10 carry 28+ active stdlib
  CVEs that `govulncheck` flags; all are resolved in 1.25.11.
- CI — test command now excludes packages without test files (`examples/`, `cmd/`) to prevent the
  `go: no such tool "covdata"` error on downloaded toolchains.

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- `pkg/logger` — **four structured log sinks** written to `logs/`: `api.log`, `consumer.log`,
  `thirdparty.log`, `trace.log`. `SetupSinks(SinkConfig)` plus `API()` / `Consumer()` / `ThirdParty()` /
  `Trace()` accessors. Rotation is selectable via `LOG_ROTATION`: `size` (lumberjack) or `daily`
  (date-stamped `api-2006-01-02.log`, midnight rollover, `LOG_MAX_AGE_DAYS` retention).
- `pkg/journal` — request/message-scoped journal stored in context. `AddThirdParty` and `AddTrace`
  append to the parent record **and** write a standalone JSON line to `thirdparty.log` / `trace.log`
  (dual-write), all sharing `request_id` + `trace_id`. Includes header redaction (`RedactHeaders`) and
  body capping (`CapBody`, skips binary content).
- `internal/delivery/http/middleware` — `AccessLog` middleware writes one JSON line per request to
  `api.log` with the **full request** (method, url, query, all headers, body) and **full response**
  (status, headers, body, latency), the correlating `trace_id`, and the embedded `thirdparty[]` /
  `trace[]` arrays. Sensitive headers are redacted; bodies are size-capped and gated by `LOG_HTTP_BODIES`.
- `pkg/httpclient` — `Client.Do` now records each outbound call into the request journal (method, url,
  host, status, latency, capped request/response bodies) when a journal is present in context — this is
  the source of the per-request "which third parties were hit" list. New `Options.LogBodyMaxBytes`.
- `pkg/messaging/kafka` & `pkg/messaging/rabbitmq` — consumers now start a per-message journal + APM/OTel
  span (continuing any propagated trace via the existing carriers) and write one structured line to
  `consumer.log` with `thirdparty[]` / `trace[]`, request_id, trace_id, latency, and status.
- `pkg/observability.TraceID(ctx)` — backend-agnostic trace-id extraction (OTel span context, then
  Elastic APM transaction) for log correlation.
- CLI skeleton — vendors `pkg/logger/sinks.go` and `pkg/journal`, the `AccessLog` middleware, and the
  previously-missing Kafka/RabbitMQ `carrier.go`; wires `SetupSinks` + `AccessLog` in `cmd/api/main.go`;
  adds `deploy/filebeat.yml` + `deploy/README.md` for shipping the four JSON logs to Elasticsearch.
- `config` — `LOG_DIR`, `LOG_ROTATION`, `LOG_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `LOG_BODY_MAX_BYTES`, `LOG_HTTP_BODIES`.

### Fixed
- CLI skeleton — the Kafka/RabbitMQ packages were missing `carrier.go`, so projects generated with
  `--kafka`/`--rabbitmq` failed to compile; the carriers are now vendored.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- `pkg/observability` — **OTel → Elastic APM bridge**: when `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=elastic_apm`, an
  `apmotel` TracerProvider is installed as the global OTel provider, so spans created via
  `otel.Tracer(...)` (including in generated usecases) are forwarded to Elastic APM and nested under the
  apmfiber transaction. Previously these spans were silently dropped under the Elastic backend.
- `pkg/observability.StartSpan(ctx, name) (context.Context, func())` — provider-agnostic helper for
  manual spans; works for OTel, Elastic APM (via the bridge), and `none` (no-op).
- CLI skeleton now vendors `pkg/observability` and `pkg/auth` as source, and `go.mod.tmpl` gained the
  OpenTelemetry, Elastic APM (`apm/v2`, `apmfiber`, `apmhttp`, `apmotel`), Prometheus, `redisotel`,
  `otelgorm`, and `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` dependencies — **generated projects now compile out of the box**
  (`go mod tidy && go build ./...`) for every `--apm` choice.

### Fixed
- `pkg/observability` setup — `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=none` now returns the no-op provider instead of
  falling through to the OTel branch, so tracing is genuinely disabled.
- Generated usecases — the package-level OTel `tracer` var is now named per-domain
  (`<domain>Tracer`), so multiple usecases generated into the same package
  (e.g. `make:all user` + `make:all product`) no longer fail to compile with `tracer redeclared`.
- CLI `make:client` template — documented how to wire `Options.TransportWrapper = obsProvider.WrapTransport`
  so outgoing third-party calls are recorded as APM/OTel child spans.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- CLI `wapgo new` — interactive project wizard (powered by `charmbracelet/huh`): prompts for project name, module path, database (PostgreSQL/MySQL), observability provider (Elastic APM / OpenTelemetry / None), and optional features (Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ) via a multi-select. Falls back to flag/default-driven non-interactive mode with `--yes` (or automatically when stdin is not a TTY) for CI use.
- CLI `wapgo add <feature>` — add an optional capability (`redis`, `kafka`, `rabbitmq`) to an existing project after scaffolding; copies the feature's source files, never overwrites existing files (idempotent), and prints the manual wiring steps for `cmd/api/main.go`, `.env`, and `docker-compose.yml`.
- Conditional scaffolding — `wapgo new` now generates only the files for selected features. Skeleton files for disabled features (Redis cache, Kafka, RabbitMQ) are omitted, and `cmd/api/main.go`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example` are rendered with feature-aware conditionals. Only the chosen database service appears in `docker-compose.yml`, and `DB_PORT` defaults to the right port (3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL).
- Styled CLI output — `wapgo new` / `wapgo add` print a colored summary and next-steps block via `charmbracelet/lipgloss`.

### Changed
- Scaffold now strips the `//go:build ignore` guard from generated Go files (the guard exists only to keep skeleton sources out of the CLI module build).
- Skeleton `internal/delivery/http/handler/health_handler.go` — refactored to be Redis-agnostic: the Redis ping is registered as a regular `AddChecker("redis", …)` from `main.go` only when Redis is enabled, instead of being a hard-coded dependency of the handler.
- `wapgo new` flags: added `--apm`, `--redis`, `--kafka`, `--rabbitmq`, `--yes/-y`; `--db` no longer defaults eagerly (the wizard/`--yes` path applies the default).

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- CLI `make:migration <name>` — generate a timestamped up/down SQL migration file pair in `migrations/` following the golang-migrate convention (`{timestamp}_{name}.up.sql` / `.down.sql`). Supports snake_case, PascalCase, and kebab-case input; generates a GORM-compatible CREATE TABLE skeleton (UUID PK, soft-delete column, index).
- `pkg/response` — `Paginated()` helper and `PaginatedResponse` / `PageMeta` types for list endpoints; `total_pages` computed automatically from `total` and `per_page`; zero-safe (perPage=0 → totalPages=0).
- CLI skeleton (`wapgo new`) — generates `README.md` with project name, module path, quick-start, make targets, project structure, and configuration reference; `DB` driver value injected from `--db` flag.
